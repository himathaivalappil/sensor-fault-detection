# SENSOR FAULT DETECTION

The Air Pressure System (APS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benefits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of natural air.

A binary classification problem in which the positive class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain APS component, while the negative class suggests that the failure was caused by something else.
